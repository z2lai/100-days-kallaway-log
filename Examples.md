## Log of Round 1 of #100DaysOfCode - done in 2016

### Day 1: June 13. Monday

**Today's Progress**: Spent time fixing CSS and figuring out how canvas works.

**Thoughts:** Feels good to be back at coding.

**Link to work:** [Pomodoro Clock App](https://github.com/Kallaway/pomodoro-clock/commit/f7590d1e8180bd63167b04494710f27d50b13890)

### Day 2: June 14 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: More progress on the canvas of the Pomodoro Clock. Worked on CSS (still figuring out Flexbox things), have done some work with HTML5 canvas.

**Thoughts:** It's a bit frustrating to spend a lot of time figuring out how the canvas works.

# Quick Version
## 100DaysOfCode Log - Round 3 - Alexander Kallaway
The log of my #100DaysOfCode (to keep separate from main repo and let others fork a clean version).
Started on July 17, Monday, 2017.

### R3D1 
Today I've started the 3rd API project from @freeCodeCamp -> http://glitch.com/edit/#!/collapse-url + started configuring mongodb
Planning to do more tomorrow: handling routes, etc. but will have to learn more about Mongo and DBs - feeling a bit lost

### R3D2
Worked on the URL Shortener App: http://glitch.com/edit/#!/collapse-url added mongodb connection, regex to determine if URL is valid. Today I honestly had the best time - for the first time ever I figured out how to work with a database (super basics). I don't know why I haven't done that before - I think I had fear of it or exaggerated the difficulty of it in my mind. And I can say that today is the day I've written something to a mongodb database for the first time ever :)

### R3D3
Finished the URL Shortener App https://collapse-url.glitch.me/ (doesn't look like much, but it works :) Feel free to test :) Here is the view into the code: http://glitch.com/edit/#!/collapse-url
