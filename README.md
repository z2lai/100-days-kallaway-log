## Log of Round 1 of #100DaysOfCode - done in 2016

### Day 1: June 13. Monday

**Today's Progress**: Spent time fixing CSS and figuring out how canvas works.

**Thoughts:** Feels good to be back at coding.

**Link to work:** [Pomodoro Clock App](https://github.com/Kallaway/pomodoro-clock/commit/f7590d1e8180bd63167b04494710f27d50b13890)

### Day 2: June 14 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: More progress on the canvas of the Pomodoro Clock. Worked on CSS (still figuring out Flexbox things), have done some work with HTML5 canvas.

**Thoughts:** It's a bit frustrating to spend a lot of time figuring out how the canvas works.
