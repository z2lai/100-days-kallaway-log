## R1D1 - May 20, Monday
Got back into coding after a 36 day hiatus (due to my car breaking down):
- Reviewed **path module in NodeJS** and the different methods to use to output a path name or directory name
- Learnt how **execution context** and **closure** applies when calling functions from imported module
- Reviewed how to serve files statically using the **static middleware of Express**
`app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public')));`
